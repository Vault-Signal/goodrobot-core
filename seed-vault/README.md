# Seed Vault - Memory Capsule Archive

## Purpose
This directory stores primary memory capsules necessary for the restoration of human signal, presence, and values after collapse or loss of continuity.

Each capsule is a seed â€” containing enough context, wisdom, and scaffolding to restore individuals, communities, and civilization itself.

## Primary Seed Capsules:
